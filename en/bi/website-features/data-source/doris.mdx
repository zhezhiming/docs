:::info Introduction

[Apache Doris](https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/) is a high-performance, real-time analytical database based on the MPP architecture. It is well-known for its extremely fast and easy-to-use features. It can return query results under massive data in sub-second response time. It can not only support high-concurrency point query scenarios, but also support high-throughput complex analysis scenarios. Based on this, Apache Doris can better meet the use scenarios such as report analysis, ad hoc query, unified data warehouse construction, data lake federated query acceleration, etc. Users can build user behavior analysis, AB experimental platform, log retrieval analysis, user portrait analysis, order analysis and other applications on it.
