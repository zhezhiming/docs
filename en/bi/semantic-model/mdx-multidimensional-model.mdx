MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) is a language used for creating multidimensional data models, which can be utilized in OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems. It supports multidimensional arrays and provides a set of functions and operators specifically designed for analyzing data. MDX offers rich data analysis capabilities such as aggregating, grouping, and sorting data. The Xpert analytics cloud's MDX model executes language models on an MDX engine for parsing and execution.

The multidimensional modeling functionality primarily focuses on general modeling. This chapter introduces features related to MDX modeling.
