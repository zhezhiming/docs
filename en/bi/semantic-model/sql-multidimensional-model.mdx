The SQL Cube is a method of using SQL statements to create dimensions, hierarchies, and multidimensional datasets to support complex data analysis. It achieves data modeling by directly converting multidimensional models into SQL statements for query and analysis. This is an intuitive and easy-to-use data analysis method that helps organizations explore data more quickly. This model is simple, easy to understand, and maintain, and can run independently on the client or server.
