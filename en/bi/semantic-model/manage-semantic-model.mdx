The **Semantic Model Management Interface** displays semantic models that users have permission to view or manage, and users can view, create, or edit semantic models.

The list of semantic models is displayed in a tree structure organized by business domain.

Clicking the create button in the top right corner of the interface allows the creation of different types of semantic models:

* **SQL** Semantic Model
* **MDX** Semantic Model
* **WASM** (SQL) Semantic Model

## Creation Wizard

Clicking the create button opens the Create Semantic Model wizard, where you can select an existing **data source** and then choose a **catalog**.

:::tip

The **Catalog** corresponds to the **Schema** used to isolate physical tables in some databases, the database instance **Database** used to isolate physical tables in other databases, and the **Catalog** used to isolate models in XMLA data sources.

:::

After selecting the service directory, proceed to the next step, enter a unique model name and *associated business domain* (optional), choose whether to use MDX modeling, and click create.

Whether to use MDX modeling:

* Yes: Create MDX model
* No: Create SQL model

## Manage Semantic Models

In the list of semantic models, you can add and delete models. Clicking the name of a semantic model navigates to the semantic model editing interface, where you can maintain and create semantic models.

### Upload Model

Clicking the upload button allows you to upload saved model files. Before uploading, you can set the name, associated business domain, and data source for the new model.

## Permissions

The semantic model list will display the following models with permissions:

- Models created by the user.
- Semantic models under the [business domain](/docs/server/organization/business-area) for which the user has permissions.

:::tip
The administrator (ADMIN) role has permissions for all business domains within the organization.
