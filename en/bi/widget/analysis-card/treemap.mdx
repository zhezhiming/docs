**Treemap** is suitable for displaying data with hierarchical relationships and can intuitively reflect comparisons between peers. A Tree structure is transformed into a state of rectangular planes.

Treemaps use rectangles to represent nodes in the hierarchy, and hierarchical relationships between parent and child nodes are expressed through the metaphor of nested rectangles. Starting from the root node, screen space is divided into multiple rectangles according to the number of corresponding child nodes, and the area size of rectangles usually corresponds to node attributes. Each rectangle is recursively divided according to the child nodes of the corresponding node until leaf nodes are reached.

The advantage of treemaps is that compared to traditional tree structure charts, treemaps can use space more effectively and have the function of displaying proportions. The disadvantage of treemaps is that when category proportions are too small, text becomes difficult to arrange. Compared to branching tree charts, treemaps' tree data structure expression is not intuitive or clear enough.

## Hierarchical Treemap

Select the chart type as Treemap, add one measure and one dimension, and set the finest level of the dimension to display and check the **Include Parent Levels** property.

The treemap will display the weight relationships between members of this hierarchy regarding this measure value:

## Multi-dimension Treemap

You can also display treemaps between multiple dimensions, add multiple measures, and do not set the include parent levels property.

The treemap will display the weight composition relationships between multiple dimensions regarding this measure value:
