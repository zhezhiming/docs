Line charts show how continuous variables change over time. The variable measuring time is plotted on the x-axis. Continuous variables are plotted on the y-axis. You can also plot a series of data points on the chart and connect these data points with lines. Line charts are particularly useful when displaying trend lines with subtle differences or trend lines with data lines that cross each other. You can use line charts to summarize categorical variables, in which case line charts are similar to bar charts.

## Line Chart

Select the chart type as **Line Chart**, and add one or more measures and one dimension.

### Dual-axis Line Chart

Dual-axis line charts can display multiple measures with two different units of measurement in the same coordinate system, making comparison easier.

Value axes can be configured by setting the measure's **Chart Properties**.

The chart properties interface can set properties such as **Series Properties**, **Axis**, **Tooltip**, and **Visual Mapping** for this measure.

## Area Chart

Area charts can be achieved by setting the color of the **Area Style** property on the basis of line charts:
