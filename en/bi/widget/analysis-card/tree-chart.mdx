**Tree Chart** (Tree) is a visualization method that uses containment relationships to express hierarchical data. Tree charts can decompose things or phenomena into branch-like structures, also called tree diagrams or system diagrams.

## Tree Chart

Select the chart type as **Tree Chart** (Tree), and add one dimension, set the finest level of the dimension to display, and set its **Include Parent Levels** property.

This way, the member data relationships of this hierarchy will be displayed in the form of a tree chart:

## Chart Subtypes

You can set the tree chart's direction as **Horizontal** or **Vertical**, and also set the tree chart subtype as **Reverse** or **Radial**.

Combining direction properties and reverse types can display tree charts in four orientations. Radial tree chart nodes are displayed in a radar emission form:
