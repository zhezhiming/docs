**Heat map** is a data visualization technique that displays the absolute magnitude of a phenomenon in two-dimensional space in the form of colors. Color changes may be through hue or intensity, providing readers with obvious visual cues about how phenomena cluster or change spatially. Heat maps have two completely different categories: clustered heat maps and spatial heat maps. In clustered heat maps, magnitudes are arranged in a matrix of fixed cell sizes, with rows and columns being discrete phenomena and categories. The ordering of rows and columns is intentional and somewhat arbitrary, aiming to suggest clustering or depict clusters discovered through statistical analysis. Cell sizes are arbitrary but large enough to be clearly visible. In contrast, in spatial heat maps, the position of a magnitude is determined by the position of that magnitude in space, with no concept of cells, and phenomena are considered continuously varying.

## Clustered Heatmap

Calculate and display heatmap data by setting two dimensions and one measure.

The two dimensions will be displayed as the horizontal and vertical axes respectively, and measure values will be used as heat values to calculate cell colors.

Users can switch heatmap colors by setting a color palette for measures.

## Calendar Heatmap

Calendar heatmaps use color mapping to display daily data changes over an annual time span.

To set the heatmap as calendar type, simply select the heatmap subtype as **Calendar**, and provide a dimension with calendar semantic type.
