**River Chart** (Streamgraph), sometimes also called "**Theme River**", is a variation of stacked area charts that displays data changes over time for different categories through a "flowing" shape. Unlike stacked area charts, river charts do not plot data on a fixed, straight axis (the baseline of stacked charts is the x-axis), but instead distribute data to a changing central baseline (this baseline is not necessarily straight).

As can be seen from the composition of river charts, river charts use colors to distinguish different categories or additional quantitative values for each category, with the flow direction parallel to the X-axis representing time. The corresponding values for each category are displayed through the width of the "river". Changes in values for each category form streams of varying thickness that converge and intertwine, hence the name "river chart".

## Creating a River Chart

Select the chart type as **River Chart**, and add one measure and two dimensions:

1. The primary dimension should be a dimension with calendar semantic type. Calendar dimension members will be converted to standard time objects.
2. The secondary dimension selects the dimension for member comparison.
