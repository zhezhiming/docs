**Funnel Chart** is a graphical representation used to visualize data changes in processes. In funnel charts, the values of dependent variables decrease in subsequent stages of the process. Funnel charts are widely used to represent sales funnels, recruitment, and order fulfillment processes.

Funnel charts are suitable for single-process, unidirectional analysis with standardized business processes, long cycles, and multiple stages. By comparing business data across funnel stages, problems can be intuitively identified and explained, leading to decision-making. Funnel charts use trapezoidal areas to represent the difference between a stage's business volume and the previous stage. Funnel charts flow from top to bottom with logical sequential relationships, showing how business objectives are completed as business processes advance.

Funnel charts always start with a 100% quantity and end with a smaller quantity. Between start and end, there are N process stages. Each stage is represented by a trapezoid, where the upper base width represents the input of the current stage, the lower base width represents the output of the current stage, and the difference between upper and lower bases visually represents the reduction in business volume at the current stage. The slope of the trapezoid edge represents the reduction rate of the current stage. By labeling different stages with different colors, users can better distinguish differences between stages. All stages in a funnel chart should use the same measure.

Select the chart type as **Funnel Chart**, and add multiple measure fields.
