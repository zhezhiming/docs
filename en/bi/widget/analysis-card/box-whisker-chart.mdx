**Box and Whisker Chart** (Box plot) is a commonly used data visualization chart for presenting statistical characteristics of datasets, including median, quartiles, maximum, minimum, and outliers. Box plots typically consist of a rectangle and two line segments, where the rectangle represents the quartiles of the data, the upper and lower line segments represent the maximum and minimum values, and the middle line segment represents the median. If outliers exist in the data, they will be separately represented as data points. Box plots can be used to compare distributions of multiple datasets and identify potential outliers and anomalies.

Box plots are typically used to analyze differences in a single measure across different categories or groups. Within a single category and group, a secondary dimension (role needs to be set to **Category2** or **Group**) is needed to obtain members to be counted. Box plots will calculate the median, quartiles, maximum, minimum, and outliers for each group of data, then draw rectangles, lines, and outlier points.

Create a chart component and select the **Box and Whisker Chart** type in the **Distribution** group, select a measure to be counted, then set two dimensions: one category dimension and one group dimension:
