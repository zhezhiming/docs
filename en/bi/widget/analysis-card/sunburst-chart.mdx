**Sunburst Chart** is a modern pie chart that goes beyond traditional pie charts and ring charts, capable of expressing clear hierarchical and belonging relationships, displaying data composition in a parent-child hierarchy. In sunburst charts, the closer to the center point, the higher the level. Between adjacent layers, the inner layer contains the outer layer.

Sunburst charts are very similar to tree charts. The difference is that tree charts are more suitable for proportional data relationships with few categories and few levels; sunburst charts are more suitable for proportional data relationships with many levels.

Sunburst chart settings are similar to other hierarchy-related chart settings.
