**Scatter charts** use two sets of data to form multiple coordinate points, examining the distribution of coordinate points to determine whether there is some relationship between two variables or to summarize the distribution pattern of coordinate points.
Scatter charts display series as a group of points. Values are represented by the position of points in the chart. Categories are represented by different markers in the chart. Scatter charts are commonly used to compare aggregated data across categories.

## Creating a Scatter Chart

The x-axis and y-axis of scatter charts use two different measure fields to determine the distribution of data items in the coordinate system, and you can set more measures to display features such as color brightness or point size.
