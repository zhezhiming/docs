**Sankey Diagram** is a specific type of flow diagram used to describe the flow from one set of values to another.

Characteristics of Sankey diagrams:

* Starting flow and ending flow are the same, the sum of all main branch widths equals the sum of all outgoing branch widths, maintaining energy balance;
* Internally, different lines represent different flow distribution situations, and their widths proportionally display the flow occupied by this branch;
* Different node widths represent flow magnitudes in specific states.

There are two data display methods for creating Sankey diagrams:

* Flow relationships between multiple dimensions.
* Flow relationships of a dimension hierarchy.

## Between Multiple Dimensions

Select the chart type as Sankey Diagram (Sankey), and set one measure and multiple dimensions.

This method displays measure relationships between different dimension members.

### Chart Direction

You can set the chart's direction property to change the Sankey diagram's horizontal or vertical display.

## Single Dimension Hierarchy

You can also set only one hierarchical measure for the Sankey diagram display.

Select a dimension, select the finest level to display and set its property **Include Parent Levels**, and the data will calculate hierarchical data for this level and all its parent members.

<!-- ### 包含 All 成员

判断层次结构是否已经包含有 **All 成员**, 如果有 All 成员可以设置桑基图的 **系列样式** 中的 **有 All 成员** 属性, 那么桑基图不在新增一个 All 节点. 否则桑基图会自动为数据添加一个 All 节点. -->
