**Tree Selector** is a common element in BI reports that allows users to select data in a hierarchical interface. Typically, tree selectors are used to organize and select large amounts of data, such as organizational structures, geographic locations, product categories, etc. Tree selectors consist of a root node and multiple child nodes, and users can filter data by expanding and collapsing nodes. This approach helps users find the data they need more quickly and makes reports more intuitive and easier to understand.
