**Calendar Selector** is typically used to analyze time series data, such as sales revenue, production volume, etc. Calendar selectors can be displayed in calendar form, allowing users to select date ranges, such as the last month, last quarter, etc. This enables better viewing of time series data and helps users with analysis and decision-making.

If the dimension's semantic type is calendar, the component will display the member selector as a calendar component. Users select the corresponding time, and the component will convert the user-selected time into the corresponding member value. If you don't want to display calendar-type dimensions as calendar components, you can set the **Controller Type** property to another type, and the filter bar component will display it as the corresponding selector component.

Calendar selector property list:

| Name | Description | Details |
