The indicator card is a card component type that displays indicators. It can set one primary indicator and multiple secondary indicators or detail indicators.

## Creating the Component

Click "Insert More" in the story dashboard editing toolbar, select the component type "Indicator Card", and add an indicator card component.

Click the newly added component to open the property editing panel on the right for property settings.

1. Select data source;
2. Select multidimensional model;
3. Select indicators under the model;

At this point, you may see an error message: 'Not set current time granularity'. This is because the indicator card is a component related to period dimensions and requires setting the current time and time granularity.

We generally set the global current time and current time granularity through the global filter bar. Click the global filter bar button on the left to open the global filter panel, click the panel and open the property settings panel on the right to set properties for the global filter bar:

1. In the options area, enable "Enable Current Time Input", select time granularity and time granularity sequence;
2. Select a preset default time, or enter a string in the format `yyyy-MM-dd` as the default time;

With the current time granularity set, the indicator data for the indicator card will be displayed.

> Note that the model corresponding to the indicator needs a time dimension.

## Detail Indicators

In addition to the primary indicator, you can also set a detail indicator list for the indicator card, generally set to detail indicators that can explain the primary indicator from a business perspective.

Click the "Detail Indicators" button to open the detail indicator settings table, add records, and select indicators.

If you don't want to use the indicator's original name, you can also set an alias for the indicator.
