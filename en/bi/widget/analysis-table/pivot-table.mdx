Pivot tables display multidimensional data in a cross-tabular format with rows and columns.

### Data Configuration

In addition to common data configuration, pivot table data configuration has the following characteristics:

* After adding dimensions to rows or columns, setting the dimension's property **Include Parent Levels** will display this dimension as a tree hierarchy in the table.
* After selecting hierarchy structure and level for this dimension, the table will load member data from the root node to this level during initialization.
* Clicking the member expand button will asynchronously load unloaded members remotely (TODO: This feature is pending development).
* Tree display on columns needs to be set for the first dimension.
* Maximum **3** dimensions can be set on columns.
* There is no limit on the number of dimensions on rows.
* The first dimension on rows that has include parent levels set will be displayed as a tree structure.
* Maximum only one tree structure will be displayed on rows.

### Table Configuration

In addition to [common table configuration](../#table-configuration), pivot tables have the following pivot-related settings:

| Property | English | Description |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Row Initial Level | **Row Initial Level** | Initial level depth of row data tree structure |
| Column Initial Level | **Column Initial Level** | Initial level depth of column data tree structure |

### Style

In addition to the common story component style settings below, above are table-specific appearance configurations:

* **Display Density**: 
* Other CSS styles for components

## Application of Indicators in Tables

In addition to configuring dimensions and measures in table rows or columns, indicators created in indicator management can also be applied in tables.

Indicators themselves will limit some dimensions of the model based on measures, leaving the remaining dimensions unlimited as free dimensions. Free dimensions of indicators will be limited in their runtime context, thus achieving limitation of all dimensions of the model.
Of course, dimensions in indicators and dimensions in runtime context may overlap. In that case, indicator measure values follow the dimension limitations of the indicator itself and are not affected by overlapping dimensions in the context.

When indicators are in tables, free dimensions of indicators will be limited by dimensions on rows and columns, and there may also be filter values from other input control components on the story that limit dimensions.

Creation Process

* Indicators are selected the same way as measures.

## Combining Tables with Input Controllers

As mentioned in the dimension limitations of indicators and tables above, input controllers can also be used to limit model dimensions. When some dimensions want users to choose themselves, this can be achieved by creating input controller components for such dimensions.

As shown in the figure below, the **Product** dimension is used as a flexible selection controller, allowing users to choose the product data they want to analyze.
