Flat tables are configured with **dimensions** as **rows** and **measures** as **columns**.

## Data Configuration

Flat table data configuration is mainly with dimensions as rows and measures as columns, without involving cases where dimension members are columns and dimensions are displayed as tree structures (that would be the function of [Pivot Table](./../pivot-grid/)).

## Table Configuration

In addition to common analytical table tree types, flat table-specific configuration options include:

| Property | English | Description |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Paging | **Paging** | Whether to display with pagination |
| Page Size | **Page Size** | Number of table rows per page |
