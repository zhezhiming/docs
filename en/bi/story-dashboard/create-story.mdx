In addition to creating a story dashboard using the [semantic model to create a new story dashboard](../models/modeling-workspace/#create-new-story-dashboard), you can also create it in the [project](./project/) homepage using three different methods:

1. Create a blank story dashboard.
2. Create a story dashboard from a story template.
3. Upload a story file to create a story dashboard.

Each method requires the following story attributes to be set:
* Story Name
* Story Description (optional)
* Select the workspace within the project (optional)
* Choose the model to use (the semantic model associated with the project)

### New Story Page

When entering the story editing interface, if the story is in its initial state, a wizard interface will appear. You can choose to create different types of story pages or create them based on a template.

### Property Configuration Bar

The property configuration bar for stories and widgets is generally divided into two sections: **Build** and **Style**.

- **Build**: Different widgets have different build property settings. Most of them include data source and model configurations, as well as the associated dimensions and measures settings.
- **Style**: The style settings for most widgets are similar, primarily involving CSS property settings for the widget elements.
