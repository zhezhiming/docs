**Dashboard Sharing Feature** in Xpert Analysis Cloud allows users to share their created dashboards with other users so that others can view and interactively explore the content of the dashboard.

The sharing feature provides the following methods:

* Share Link: Users can generate a share link and send it to others. These people can use the link to directly access the dashboard.
* Embed Code: Users can obtain an embed code and embed it into their own web pages or applications to display the dashboard within their applications.

There are three levels of content sharing for stories:

* Story Level: Share the link 🔗 of the entire story, and the linked webpage will present the complete story content to the user.
  * Click the share menu in the story designer toolbar, select share, and obtain the link and embed code in the pop-up share wizard window.
* Story Point Level: Generate a link to share a single story point page, and the webpage will only display the content of the current story point page.
  * Click the more button on the story point page tab to pop up the edit menu, click the share button to open the story point share wizard window, and obtain the link and embed code.
* Story Widget Level: You can also share or embed a single story widget, and the webpage will only display the content of a single story widget.
  * Click the share button in the menu of a single story widget to open the story widget share wizard window and obtain the link and embed code.

Permission settings:

* Public: Anyone can access the shared content through a separate public link.
* Internal: Users share with users who have permission to access.
  * Key: Users can set a sharing key, and only those who know the key can access the shared content. The sharing key can be set to expire, after which the shared content will no longer be accessible.
