The execution explanation feature provided in the dashboard of the Xpert Analytics Cloud is a very useful tool for creators. It helps users understand the query statements, data results, error messages, and graphic configurations used in current story components such as graphs or tables. It provides a transparent way to review and understand the logic and data flow behind data visualization components.

In the story editing workspace, click on the menu in the upper right corner of the story component, or the explanation button in the right-click menu, to open the execution explanation panel, as shown in the figure below:

- **Query Statement**: Typically includes SQL queries or MDX queries used to retrieve data from the data source. This allows users to understand how data is filtered, sorted, aggregated, or processed. This is very helpful for understanding the source and process of data visualization.
- **Data Result Table**: Displays the dataset returned by the query. Users can view specific values, fields, and calculation results in the table to gain a deeper understanding of the data behind the visualization.
- **Error Messages**: Help users quickly identify and resolve issues that occur during query or data processing.
- **Graphic Configuration**: Such as chart types, axis settings, color mapping, etc. This allows users to understand how the appearance and behavior of visualization components are defined.
- **Execution Time**: To be soon...
