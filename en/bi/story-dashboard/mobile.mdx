When building a story, the page layout construction for mobile environments can be achieved through a set of device-related buttons provided in the toolbar.

Once the mobile device button is activated, the story building page will be displayed in a mobile device-sized mode:

* **Device Model**: The button menu allows you to choose from common mobile device sizes.
* **Adaptation**: Scale the mobile device size for easier viewing of the overall effect or details.
* **Orientation**: Switch the handheld orientation of the mobile device: landscape or portrait.
* **Foldable Device**: If the selected mobile device is a foldable one, click this button to toggle the device's fold/unfold state.

## Page Layout Adjustment

In the mobile device environment, the page layout needs to be adjusted accordingly. By default, the canvas page uses a fixed-size layout. On mobile devices, a **vertical scroll** layout type should be used so that the page adapts to the device width horizontally and scrolls vertically.

* **Minimum Columns**: Removed.
* **Minimum Rows**: Removed.

You can also choose the **Fixed Height Layout** type when creating a new canvas page. For more details, refer to [New Canvas Page](../workspace/#new-canvas-page).
