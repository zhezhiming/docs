In the Indicator Management System, a business area refers to the division and organization of business domains or functions. It represents different business departments, processes, or functions within an enterprise, such as sales, procurement, production, human resources, etc. Each business area typically includes a set of related indicators and models used to measure and monitor the performance of that business area.

Its functions are as follows:

1. **Organization and Classification**: Business areas organize and classify the enterprise's operations into different areas, helping users better understand and manage various business departments or functions. It provides a clear structure that allows the indicator management system to organize and display data according to business areas.

2. **Fine-grained Indicator Management**: By dividing indicators into business areas, fine-grained indicator management for different business areas can be achieved. Each business area can define specific indicators and metrics applicable to that area to better measure and monitor key performance indicators in that business area.

3. **Business-Driven Decision Making**: The establishment of business areas enables the indicator management system to support business-driven decision-making. By associating relevant indicators and metrics with specific business areas, decision-makers can quickly understand and analyze the performance of various business areas, enabling targeted decision-making and strategic adjustments.

4. **Configurability and Flexibility**: The presence of business areas provides configurability and flexibility to the indicator management system. Different business areas can be customized according to the enterprise's needs, including the definition of indicators, calculation rules, and display methods. This allows the system to flexibly adjust and expand according to different business requirements.
