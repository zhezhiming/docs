The Indicator Registration page is a functional page used to register individual new indicators or to bulk upload indicator definitions. Below are the main contents and functions of this page:

1. **Basic Information**: Basic information about the indicator, such as indicator name, description, unit, etc. These information are the basic attributes of the indicator, used to help users better understand and use the indicator.
2. **Model Information**: Model information related to the indicator, such as model name, model entity, dimensions, and measures, etc.

## Creating Business Domains

In the management of indicators, whether through business domains, product lines, or departments for classification and management of indicators, an organizational structure is needed to manage indicators of different attribute categories. We manage indicators by grouping them under business domains.

Refer to [Business Domain Management](../server/organization/business-area)

1. First, open the **Business Domain** page, click on "Create Business Domain," and enter a name such as **Finance**.
2. Click the add button on the Finance row to continue adding child business domains, such as **Management Reports**.
3. Continue adding sub-sections of Management Reports: **Core Indicators**, **Revenue Indicators**, **Profit and Loss Indicators**, etc.

## Registering Indicators

Next, create specific indicators.

:::tip Unique Code

Indicator codes are only limited to uniqueness within the semantic model's multidimensional dataset; there are no restrictions at the business domain or global level, and users regulate them themselves.

:::

1. Open the indicator registration page and enter the following indicator information:

- Basic Information

| Name         | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Indicator Name | Language description of the indicator. From a management perspective, indicator names are unique, but the system itself does not enforce this uniqueness. |
| Indicator Code | Unified indicator code, facilitating user memory and query of indicators.                       |
| Business Domain | The business sector to which the indicator belongs (i.e., business domain). For example, we can put **Total Company Revenue** into the core indicator business domain. |
| Authentication Process | The authentication process of the indicator in the indicator system.                       |
| Creator | The creator of the indicator.                                                                              |
| Responsible Person | The person responsible for the indicator in the business.                                                     |
| Unit of Measure | The unit of measure for the indicator, such as **RMB**.                                                        |
| Validity Period | The validity period of the indicator.                                                                |
| Activation Status | Whether the indicator is in an active state.                                                               |
| Indicator Application Availability | Whether the indicator is available for use in indicator applications.                                            |
| Business Caliber | A language description of the indicator from a caliber perspective. The definition of indicator business caliber needs to be determined according to specific business scenarios and requirements, generally formulated jointly by business experts, data analysts, data managers, etc. At the same time, the indicator business caliber also needs to match the design of the data source to ensure the correctness, reliability, and repeatability of the indicator calculation results. |

- Model Information

| Name         | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Semantic Model | The semantic model to which the indicator belongs.                                                      |
| Model Entity | A specific multidimensional model in the semantic model where the indicator data comes from.                      |
| Indicator Type | **Basic Indicator**: Select a measure from the existing measure fields in the semantic model for the indicator to use as the quantity value. <br/> [**Derived Indicator**](./derivative-indicator/): Data values obtained by combining existing measures and dimensions through calculation formulas. |
| Visibility | Whether the indicator is visible to users when used in the frontend.                                                          |
| Measure | When the indicator type is **Basic Indicator**, select a measure as the quantity value of the indicator.                                                                  |
| Calculation Formula | When the indicator type is **Derived Indicator**, enter the calculation formula for the indicator measure value.                                                                      |
| Aggregation Type | When the indicator type is **Derived Indicator**, specify an aggregation type for the calculation formula; defaults to using the aggregation type of the measure for **Basic Indicator**.                                          |
| Free Dimensions | Dimensions on the multidimensional model unrestricted for this indicator. Will be selected or restricted when displayed.                                               |

## Bulk Upload

For initial indicator entry or bulk indicator creation, you can use the bulk upload feature.

First, download the model file for bulk uploading indicator data. To facilitate manual organization of indicator data, you can download data similar to a particular indicator, then modify it by copying, open an existing indicator, or enter a new one, then click the **Download Template** button to download the current indicator data as a template. After organizing the indicator data, click the **Bulk Upload** button to upload.

As shown in the figure below, during bulk import, users can modify the attribute configuration of indicators one by one, and then click the "Import" button to complete the bulk import of indicators.

![Indicator Batch Import](/public/img/indicator/indicator-batch-import.png)

Below is a YAML format template for an indicator:

```yaml
- name: ADJ Rosy Sunglasses Profit
  code: 'Demo: ADJ-R-Sun Profit'
  isActive: true
  isApplication: true
  visible: true
  businessAreaId: 13ce2de2-a53f-4ad8-9c9d-8806291c77ec
  authentication: ERP
  business: |-
    Profit of the product "ADJ Rosy Sunglasses" is the profit obtained by deducting the main business income from the main business cost and the main business taxes and surcharges.
    Since the profit from the main business has not yet deducted period expenses such as sales expenses, management expenses, financial expenses, etc., it cannot fully reflect the profit status of the company's main business.
