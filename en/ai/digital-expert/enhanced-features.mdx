### 3. Conversation Summary

When the number of conversation messages exceeds the set maximum tolerance (e.g., 100 messages), Xpert will use the "Conversation Summary" feature to extract important information from historical conversations and convert it into concise summaries, reducing system memory burden and improving the focus and efficiency of subsequent conversations.

#### 🧠 Working Mechanism

- **Maximum Tolerance**: Sets the upper limit of new conversation messages allowed before starting to generate a new summary. For example, if shown as 22, this means that even if the conversation exceeds 16 rounds, the system will continue recording until reaching 22 rounds before triggering a new summary generation. This parameter helps avoid frequent summary generation, thereby reducing computational overhead.
- **Number of Messages to Summarize**: The number of messages to be summarized, for example, 16 in the figure means summarizing the first 16 messages out of 22 messages in the session.
- **Retention Count**: The number of messages retained after summarization, for example, 4 in the figure means retaining 4 messages, and the remaining messages will be deleted (appearing as summaries in system prompts).
- **Prompt**: Used to guide the system on how to summarize historical messages in conversations. If not provided, the system uses default prompts.

> Example configuration:
> Maximum tolerance: 100
> Summary trigger count: 40
> 👉 Retention count = 100 - 40 = 60 messages

#### 📋 Application Scenarios

* Long-term interaction between users and agents
* Multi-round complex task follow-up
* Conversation flows requiring periodic knowledge summaries or task reviews

### 4. Long-term Memory

See [Long-term Memory](../long-term-memory.md) documentation.

---

### 5. Memory Reply

Memory Reply functionality allows manually editing and storing specific Q&A-style memories for agents. When users ask questions, the system can prioritize matching these "memory" contents, directly generating high-quality, stable, and controllable replies, skipping the LLM's free generation process.
This mechanism effectively improves Q&A consistency and reliability, especially suitable for customized, rule-defined, or hallucination-sensitive scenarios.

#### 🧠 Working Mechanism

* **Q&A Memory Creation**: Developers can manually write several Q&A pairs (question + standard answer) for agents as [Long-term Memory](../long-term-memory.md) content.
* **Similarity Matching**: When users ask questions, the system uses Embedding vectors to calculate the similarity between user input and all memory questions.
* **Score Threshold Judgment**: Only when the similarity score ≥ set threshold will the system recall and directly return the first answer from the corresponding memory.
* **Embedding Model**: Uses the Embedding model configured for long-term memory. If not set, uses the system's global default model.

#### ⚙️ Configuration Parameter Description

| Parameter | Description |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Score Threshold | Controls the similarity score boundary for whether memory is recalled (e.g., 0.85) |
| Embedding Model | Uses the Embedding model configured for long-term memory |

#### 📌 Application Scenarios

- ✅ Standardized replies for specific domains<br/>
    Suitable for knowledge base scenarios in enterprises, government, education, finance, etc., where precise control over answers is needed for some questions, such as:
  * "What is the company's customer service phone number?"
  * "Can I delete my account?"
  * "Does this system support overseas users?"

These questions should typically have clear results or avoid generating hallucination content.

- ✅ Rapid Prototype (POC/DEMO) Construction

In POC or DEMO stages, manually entering Q&A memories can quickly tune product performance and meet customer expectations.

- ✅ Parallel use with RAG as stable fallback

The Memory Reply mechanism is equivalent to a lightweight, controllable retrieval enhancement system (RETRIEVAL ONLY), effectively avoiding hallucinations or irrelevant answers in the large model generation process.

#### ✨ Feature Advantages

* 🎯 Improves answer stability and determinism
* 💡 Avoids hallucination issues from large model free generation
* 🧩 Supports parallel use with knowledge base, search, and other modules

### 6. Conversation Title

Conversation Title functionality automatically extracts a concise, summary title based on conversation content after the user initiates a session for the first time, serving as the session title for that round of conversation. This feature enhances the browsability and organization of multi-round conversations, especially suitable for scenarios with many agent chat records.

| Configuration Item | Description |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| Enable/Disable | Enabled by default, system will automatically generate titles for each new session |
| Title Prompt | Supports configuring prompts to guide the large model to generate summary titles in specified styles or formats |

The system will automatically trigger title generation logic after the user sends the first message or when the system identifies that the conversation has initially formed.

#### 🧩 Examples

| Conversation Content | Auto-generated Title |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| "I want to understand our sales department's performance last month, can you break it down by region?" | Sales Department Last Month Performance Analysis |
| "Can you help me write an introduction copy for the AI assistant feature? Make it a bit more relaxed in style." | AI Assistant Feature Copy Writing Request |
| "Please explain the principles and application scenarios of the Memory Reply mechanism." | Memory Reply Mechanism Explanation |

#### 🛠️ Configuration Suggestions

* For structured conversation scenarios (such as BI Q&A, ticket systems), it is recommended to customize prompts to generate titles based on user intent or entity fields.
* Prompts should guide generation of **concise, specific, no redundant words** titles, for example:

  ```
  Summarize a one-sentence title to mark the theme of this user's question, avoiding redundant words.
  ```
