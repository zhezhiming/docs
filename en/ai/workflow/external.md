In the Xpert AI platform, the agent node invokes the **External [Xpert](/docs/ai/xpert/)** feature to allow the Agent to call external **Expert Teams** to handle specific tasks or provide specialized knowledge support. External experts refer to independent digital experts outside the agent combination, with a complete and independent agent orchestration process.

1. **Calling External Experts**:  
   - The **agent node** can call **External Xpert** based on task requirements to handle complex tasks that cannot be completed solely with internal knowledge bases or tools.  
   - For example, when a task involves specific industry knowledge or complex data analysis, the agent node will pass the request to the external expert team.

2. **Knowledge Augmentation and Decision Support**:  
   - External experts can provide advanced knowledge or specialized technical support to enhance the agent node's capabilities. For example, external experts can query the latest industry data, provide market analysis, or make judgments based on specific business rules.

3. **Task Collaboration**:  
   - When a task requires support from multiple areas of expertise, the agent node can coordinate multiple external experts to work together. For example, when handling interdisciplinary projects, multiple external expert teams can provide insights from their respective fields to ensure the task's comprehensiveness and accuracy.

4. **Intelligent Decision Making**:  
   - External experts can also participate in the decision-making process, providing additional context or opinions to help the agent node make more accurate judgments, especially in cases requiring advanced analysis or complex scenarios.

5. **Data Enhancement**:  
   - External experts can connect to external data sources (such as third-party databases or APIs), enabling the agent node to access richer data, thus enhancing the basis for decision-making.

### Use Cases:
- **Professional Consulting**: The agent node calls external experts to provide professional knowledge or consulting services when handling tasks in specific fields.
- **Complex Task Execution**: When tasks involve cross-disciplinary or complex decision-making, the agent node can collaborate with external expert teams to ensure efficient task completion.
- **Real-time Data Querying**: Accessing the latest data or information sources through external experts to improve the timeliness and accuracy of tasks.
