“Toolset” enhances workflows with powerful third-party capabilities, categorized into three types:
- **Built-in Tools**, provided by the XpertAI platform, may require configuration or authorization before use.
- **Custom Tools**, imported or configured via OpenAPI/Swagger standards. If built-in tools don’t meet needs, create custom tools in XpertAI workspace menu — Custom Tools.
- **MCP Tools**, based on Model Context Protocol standards, enable AI to call external systems via a unified interface for queries or automation, configurable in XpertAI workspace, requiring authentication and authorization.
