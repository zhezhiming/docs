In Xpert Agents, the `END` node is a special node used to represent the termination point of a graph. When the execution flow reaches the `END` node, it signifies that the execution of the graph is complete, and the process will stop.

When defining the orchestration structure of an Xpert agent, you can use an `END` agent or tool node to explicitly specify the end of the process.

It is important to ensure that the logic of the graph is correctly designed to avoid unexpected loops or continued execution after reaching the `END` node.
