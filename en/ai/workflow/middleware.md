In workflow orchestration, an agent middleware node is a pluggable processing module that can intercept, transform, or enhance an agent's behavior at specific points in the agent's execution chain, without needing to modify the agent's core logic itself.

For more details, see [Agent Middleware](/docs/ai/middleware/).
