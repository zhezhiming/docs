## Background

In traditional data analytics platforms, data modeling has always been a high-barrier task that heavily relies on manual expertise. Data engineers often need to manually design models, configure dimensions, define measures, and more—making the process inefficient and error-prone.  
To improve modeling efficiency and lower the entry barrier, we have built a set of **Semantic Model Tools** on the **XpertAI Agent Platform**, aiming to assist users in constructing and maintaining multidimensional data models with the help of intelligent agents.

This toolset is seamlessly integrated with the **XpertAI Data Analytics Platform** and can be used in conjunction with modules such as ChatBI, intelligent Q&A, and indicator management, providing an end-to-end experience from model building, debugging, and previewing to intelligent analysis.

#### 🌟 Value Proposition

* ✅ **AI-assisted Modeling**: Leveraging LLM capabilities, users only need to describe their business scenario, and the agent will recommend and generate the initial modeling structure (such as dimensions, indicators, hierarchies, etc.)
* ✅ **Self-service Modeling Portal**: Build Cubes via visual or semantic operations—no deep SQL skills required to define analytical models
* ✅ **Modeling-Analysis Linkage**: Instantly preview model results to quickly validate modeling configurations
* ✅ **Cost Reduction & Efficiency**: Reduce over 70% of repetitive modeling workload, enabling more analysts to perform "light modeling"
* ✅ **Unified Modeling Interface**: Modular and service-oriented tool functions, connectable to external systems or workflow orchestration

#### 📌 Use Cases

* In intelligent Q&A systems, automatically build or adjust data models based on questions (e.g., add missing dimensions, create calculated indicators)
* When launching new business indicators, automatically create multidimensional analysis models via ChatBI
* Analysts describe business logic in natural language, and the agent generates and deploys the model
* In data governance scenarios, assist in maintaining model consistency and traceability

## Tool Overview

### 1. Switch Workspace `switch_model_workspace`

This tool is used to **switch to a specified semantic model workspace** or **create a new workspace and initialize its state** during the intelligent modeling process. This is the first step in modeling, ensuring that subsequent operations (tables, Cubes, dimensions, etc.) are performed in the correct model context.

It calls backend services to initialize or load the model workspace and synchronizes the current model state to the context for subsequent operations.

Typical use cases:

* Start a new modeling task by creating a brand-new model workspace
* Switch to an existing model for adjustment or extension
* Prompt the user via the agent to specify or create a model

### 2. List Physical Tables `list_tables`

This tool **lists all physical tables in the data source associated with the current semantic model**. It is useful at the start of modeling to help users understand the available table structures, serving as the basis for subsequent modeling (such as selecting tables to build Cubes, defining dimensions, etc.).

The tool queries the underlying data source (e.g., database, data lake) based on the model's `modelId` and `catalog/schema` information and returns a list of tables.

### 3. List Table Schema `list_table_schema`

This tool **views the field (column) structure of a specified table**, including field names, data types, etc., helping users understand the table structure for modeling (such as building dimensions or measures).

#### 🧾 Input Parameters

| Name         | Type     | Description           |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------- |
| `tableName`  | `string` | Name of the table     |

#### 📤 Output

Returns the field structure information (name, type, comment, etc.) of the selected table, including:

* Readable JSON format (for agent presentation)
* Raw structure data (for UI use)

### 4. List Cubes `list_cubes`

This tool **lists all defined Cubes in the semantic model workspace**, helping the LLM understand the core analytical units in the current modeling context for subsequent modeling-related tool calls (such as reading Cubes, editing dimensions, measures, etc.).

The tool extracts all defined Cubes from the model draft (`draft.schema.cubes`) and returns their `name`, `caption`, and `description`.

#### 🧾 Input Parameters

| Name       | Type     | Description                                                                 |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `modelId`  | `string` | Optional. Specifies the semantic model workspace ID. If omitted, uses context. |

#### 📤 Output

Returns two parts (for LLM use):

* `content`: Formatted JSON string with basic info of all Cubes
* `artifact`: Structured data array for downstream toolchains

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Sales",
    "caption": "Sales Cube",
    "description": "Cube for sales analysis"
  },
  {
    "name": "Inventory",
    "caption": "Inventory Cube",
    "description": "Cube for stock tracking"
  }
]
```

### 5. Read Cube `read_cube`

This tool **reads the definition of a specified Cube**, including its dimensions, measures, hierarchies, etc., helping the LLM understand a specific analytical subject in the current semantic model.

The tool looks up the target Cube in the model draft of the current workspace, returns the complete structure, and triggers a Cube message event for dashboard display.

#### 🧾 Input Parameters

| Name         | Type     | Description           |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------- |
| `cube_name`  | `string` | Name of the Cube      |

#### 📤 Output

Returns the complete definition of the target Cube (JSON string + raw object) for further reasoning or editing recommendations.

### 6. Edit Shared Dimension `edit_dimension`

This tool **creates or updates a shared dimension in the semantic model**. If the dimension name matches, it updates; otherwise, it creates a new one.

It allows the LLM to define dimension properties (name, type, description, hierarchies, etc.) via structured parameters, automatically validating completeness and correctness to ensure safe inclusion in the model draft.

After completion, it updates the model draft and generates a link for UI navigation to the dimension management page.
