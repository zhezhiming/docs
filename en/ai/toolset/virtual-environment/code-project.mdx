:::tip PRO
This feature is supported in the **Pro Edition**.
:::

This toolset provides a one-stop, end-to-end solution for building and managing **frontend code projects**, covering key functional modules such as project initialization, coding development, runtime debugging, deployment, and file management.

📌 **The current version only supports React project templates**. More project types (e.g., Vue, Next.js, Svelte, Python, Node.js, etc.) will be gradually introduced to meet diverse development needs.

Whether you're building frontend prototypes, previewing page components, or deploying lightweight web applications, this toolset enables efficient completion.

## 📦 Tool Overview

| Tool Name                     | Function Description                     |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `code_project_init`           | Initializes a React project structure, generating a basic code structure using preset templates |
| `code_project_code`           | Writes or modifies code files in the project            |
| `code_project_run`            | Executes run commands, starts a local development server, or builds instructions    |
| `code_project_deploy`         | Deploys the project as an accessible webpage, generating a shareable link       |
| `code_project_list_files`     | Views the structure of all files in the project             |
| `code_project_read_file`      | Opens and reads the contents of a specified project file            |

## 🛠️ Detailed Tool Functions

### 1. `code_project_init` - Initialize Project

Creates a standard **React project** structure, automatically adding essential directories, including:

- `src/` Source code directory
- `public/` Static resources directory
- `package.json` Package management file
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Default pages like `App.jsx`, `index.jsx`

📌 *Currently only provides React templates; support for other frameworks is under development.*

### 2. `code_project_code` - Write Code

Add or modify any file in the project, suitable for:

- Adding components or page files (e.g., `Home.jsx`, `Button.tsx`)
- Editing existing file contents
- Automatically saving to the project space, no manual upload management required

> 📌 Can be combined with intelligent suggestions for writing React + Tailwind CSS page structures

### 3. `code_project_run` - Run Commands

Supports executing commands like `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, etc.:

- Starts a local development server for debugging
- Builds static resources for deployment
- Outputs logs to help troubleshoot errors

### 4. `code_project_deploy` - Deploy Project

Deploys the current project to an online environment with one click, automatically generating a webpage URL for access and embedding:

- Automatically builds and uploads artifacts to the platform’s hosting space
- Directly accessible via the generated link
- Ideal for quick showcases, prototype reviews, or embedded demos

### 5. `code_project_list_files` - File List

Lists all file structures in the current project, supporting nested directory expansion and file navigation.

### 6. `code_project_read_file` - Read File Content

Opens and views any project file, supporting code preview and content verification, commonly used for debugging or content reuse.

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

1. **Project Initialization**: Use `code_project_init` to create a React project
2. **Write Pages and Components**: Add `.jsx`, `.css`, etc., files using `code_project_code`
3. **Run and Debug**: Execute build or local debugging commands with `code_project_run`
4. **Deploy and Publish**: Use `code_project_deploy` to obtain an accessible link
5. **File Management**: Use `code_project_list_files` and `code_project_read_file` for assistance

## 🚀 Example Use Cases

- Building and launching frontend prototypes quickly
- Converting AI-generated pages into accessible webpages
- Embedding into other system modules as interactive components or visual outputs
- Frontend teaching, component demos, or design reviews

## 🎯 Core Advantages

| Advantage            | Description                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| 🔄 Full Workflow Support | Automates the entire process from initialization to development and deployment |
| 📦 No Local Environment Needed | Fully online, no need to install Node.js or configure build environments |
| ⚡ Fast Publishing       | Second-level deployment, instantly generates accessible links |
| 🔐 Secure Isolation     | Each project space is independent, ensuring user content security |

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

To support more development scenarios, the platform will soon support the following project types:

- Vue / Nuxt
- Next.js
- Svelte / SvelteKit
- Python
- Node.js
- Pure static HTML projects, etc.

Stay tuned for updates and explore richer development template capabilities!

## 📘 Summary

The **Code Project Toolset** provides a complete automated solution from “writing code” to “deploying webpages.” Whether you’re building components, quickly validating designs, or creating product prototypes, you can accomplish it all on this platform.

Currently tailored for React projects, we will continue to expand support for more template types to meet the diverse needs of developers.

For more complex intelligent development workflows, you can also integrate with other intelligent Agents and automation tool modules to build cross-task, cross-model intelligent collaborative workflows.
