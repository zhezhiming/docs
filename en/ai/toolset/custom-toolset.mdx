A **Custom Toolset** is a collection of tools created and configured by users to meet their specific needs, designed to extend the system's functionality and flexibility. With custom toolsets, users can integrate various services and data sources to address specific business requirements.

Custom toolsets support multiple protocols, including:

- **OpenAPI Protocol**: OpenAPI is a standardized format for describing RESTful APIs. By supporting OpenAPI, custom toolsets can easily integrate with REST-based services, providing standardized interface definitions and interaction methods.

- **OData Protocol**: OData is an open protocol for accessing and querying data. Custom toolsets that support OData can interact with various data sources, offering flexible data query and operation capabilities.


## Custom OpenAPI Toolset

The custom OpenAPI toolset allows users to create toolsets by providing a URL or manually entering a Swagger OpenAPI specification. The system automatically parses the specification, identifying API paths and parameters, simplifying the integration process.

Users only need to provide the URL of the OpenAPI specification or directly input the content in the interface. The system then generates the corresponding interface definitions, enabling users to quickly build and configure custom toolsets.

## Custom OData Toolset

The custom OData toolset allows users to create toolsets by providing the URL of an OData service or manually entering OData metadata. The system automatically parses the metadata to identify entity sets and generates the corresponding CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface definitions, streamlining the integration process.

Users can simply provide the OData service URL or directly input the metadata content in the interface. The system will generate the necessary interface definitions, helping users quickly build and configure custom toolsets.

## Authorization Methods

Custom API toolsets support the following authorization methods:

1. **None**: No authorization required to access the API. This method is suitable for public API interfaces that users can call without providing credentials.

2. **Basic**: Basic authorization using a username and password. Users must include a Base64-encoded combination of the username and password in the request header for authentication.

3. **API Key**: Authorization using an API key. Users must include a specific API key in the request, typically passed through the request header or query parameters, to validate access permissions.

These authorization methods provide flexible options to meet the security requirements of different APIs.
