After creating the knowledge base, you can continue to manage and optimize it to ensure it provides more accurate contextual support for agents or applications.
XpertAI supports maintaining and improving the knowledge base in various ways after the knowledge pipeline is published:

### Manage the Pipeline

You can directly browse and edit the pipeline structure, adjust node configurations, or update document transformation strategies to optimize knowledge processing and retrieval effectiveness.

### Knowledge Base Maintenance

On the knowledge base page, you can:

* **Update file content**: Re-upload or replace knowledge files;
* **Perform retrieval tests**: Verify retrieval effectiveness and evaluate Q&A accuracy;
* **Modify the pipeline**: Return to the pipeline editing interface for optimization;
* **Edit knowledge base properties**: Including basic information such as name, description, and tags.
