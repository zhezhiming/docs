title: "Step 3: Publish the Knowledge Pipeline"
sidebar_position: 3

After you have finished orchestrating and debugging your knowledge pipeline, you can officially publish it.
In XpertAI, **a Knowledge Pipeline is an extension of a Digital Expert's capabilities**, so its publishing process is identical to that of a Digital Expert.

Click the **"Publish"** button in the upper right corner of the page. Enter a release note in the popup and confirm to successfully publish the knowledge pipeline.

Once published, you can perform the following actions:

### 🧩 Add Documents

Click this option to jump to the data source configuration page of the knowledge base, where you can directly upload documents or import them from third-party sources (such as Feishu Docs, web scraping, etc.).

### 🔗 Access the API

Go to the API documentation page to view how to call the knowledge pipeline API, including input/output parameters and sample code, making it easy for external systems to integrate and invoke.

### 🧠 Download as a Knowledge Pipeline Template

You can download the current pipeline as a reusable template.
The template will be displayed in the custom template list (in development), allowing other knowledge bases to quickly reuse the same knowledge processing logic.
