title: Ways to Use the Knowledge Base
sidebar_position: 7

In the **XpertAI** platform, the knowledge base is not only a central repository of information but also a core element that drives the agent’s understanding, analysis, and decision-making. By deeply integrating the knowledge base with digital expert workflows, you can ensure that agents have access to real, accurate, and traceable knowledge support when performing tasks.

XpertAI currently supports three main ways to use the knowledge base, suitable for different scenarios and task requirements.

---

## 1. Using the "Knowledge Retrieval Node" to Access the Knowledge Base

The **[Knowledge Retrieval Node](/docs/ai/workflow/knowledge)** is one of the core capabilities in XpertAI agent workflows. It can automatically search the constructed knowledge base for content fragments most semantically relevant to the user's input question and pass these fragments as **contextual information** to downstream agent nodes.

This process ensures that the agent’s responses are always based on real knowledge sources, rather than solely generated by language models, significantly improving the accuracy and consistency of answers.

**Typical use cases:**

* Providing factual support for LLMs in Q&A workflows;
* Supplying industry or internal company background knowledge for agents in business analysis or report interpretation;
* Serving as a knowledge pre-processing module in complex tasks such as document summarization and decision support.

## 2. Empowering Agents to Autonomously Access the Knowledge Base via "Knowledge Base Tool Node"

Beyond fixed retrieval nodes, XpertAI also supports registering the knowledge base as a [**Tool**](/docs/ai/xpert/#如何检索知识库) for agents. In this mode, agents can **autonomously decide** whether to access the knowledge base during conversations or task execution, dynamically integrating retrieval results into their responses.

You can add a "Knowledgebase Node" to the agent—
this node allows the agent to proactively access the knowledge base to supplement knowledge or verify information as needed.

**Advantages:**

* Enhances agent autonomy and contextual flexibility;
* Suitable for long conversations and multi-turn reasoning in complex agents;

## 3. Enabling a General Knowledge Base in the Project Workspace

For collaborative scenarios across workflows or multiple tasks, XpertAI supports adding a general knowledge base in the **Project Workspace**. This knowledge base is available to all general agents within the project, allowing them to automatically retrieve required knowledge when performing any task, without additional node configuration.

This enables your project team to:

* Consolidate internal documents, operation manuals, industry reports, etc., into a unified knowledge source;
* Allow agents to directly reference shared knowledge when performing report analysis, customer Q&A, document writing, and other tasks;
* Ensure all team agents work based on the same information system.

## 4. Coming Soon: Agents Autonomously Orchestrating Knowledge Pipelines

With the release of **XpertAI 3.6**, the knowledge base feature will be fully upgraded to a **Knowledge Pipeline**. In future versions, agents will be able to autonomously orchestrate the pipeline, dynamically acquiring applicable knowledge based on task objectives and context, achieving **real-time, on-demand knowledge access**.

This feature will make knowledge the agent’s “long-term memory,” enabling enterprises to truly build a **trustworthy and explainable knowledge intelligence system**.
