> Enterprise-grade universal agent platform supporting hybrid task orchestration for single and multi-agent collaboration.

## What is the XpertAI Project?

[XpertAI Project](/docs/ai/chat/project/) is a customizable enterprise **universal agent project space**, orchestrating multiple capability units, including:

- 📎 Attachments (data/file input)
- 🛠 Custom tools (API, scripts, browser, etc.)
- 📚 Knowledge base (structured/unstructured knowledge)
- 👤 Digital expert agents (specialized skill-based agents)

The universal agent behind the project has task decision-making capabilities (exploration or planning mode), dynamically invoking resources to complete tasks autonomously or collaboratively.

## Insights from Debate

### Background: Two Mainstream Views on Multi-Agent Systems

Two recent articles highlight industry perspectives on multi-agent systems:

- **Anthropic’s “[How we built our multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system)”**: Emphasizes multi-agent systems for “low-dependency, parallelizable” tasks, showcasing efficiency in complex research tasks.
- **Cognition (Devin AI’s parent company) “[Don’t Build Multi-Agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents)”**: Argues that in highly coupled, context-heavy scenarios (e.g., AI programming), multi-agents create collaboration and context management issues, advocating for single-agent context consistency.

These seemingly opposing views reflect rational choices for different task contexts. Beyond single-task solutions, **agent reusability** is key for enterprise platforms. XpertAI supports both architectures, focusing on reusable “digital experts” as enterprise knowledge assets, configurable across projects and workflows.

## Mode Analysis: Multi-Agent vs. Single-Agent

### Mode 1: Multi-Agent Collaboration (Parallel Tasks)

> Multiple specialized “digital expert agents” coordinated by a universal agent.

**📌 Use Cases**:
- Market research, competitor analysis, batch audits
- Multi-document integration, large-scale knowledge retrieval
- Low-dependency, concurrent subtasks

**✅ Design Principles**:
- Main agent (universal) decomposes tasks, coordinates workflows
- Sub-agents execute specific subtasks with independent contexts
- Structured output, main agent aggregates results

**⚙️ Configuration**:
- Set up multiple “digital expert” agents (e.g., web search, summarization, comparison experts)
- Define clear goals and formats for subtasks to ensure stable outputs
- Main agent uses control prompts for collaborative integration

**⚠️ Risks**:
- Sub-agents can’t share context, limiting applicability
- Task dependencies require main agent to manage context

**🔎 Example**:
“Analyze strategic plans, revenue, and trends of 10 energy companies.”
→ Main agent splits tasks → Sub-agents research each company → Main agent compiles structured report.

> Collaboration among experts is coordinated by the universal agent without human intervention.

### Mode 2: Single-Agent Execution (Sequential Tasks)

> Universal agent autonomously plans and executes tasks using all resources.

**📌 Use Cases**:
- AI programming, script generation, financial reporting
- Contract drafting, legal reviews, process rule creation
- Long task chains, high context coupling

**✅ Design Principles**:
- Maintain complete context to avoid fragmentation
- Step-by-step task progression to manage token pressure
- Use summarization to maintain information continuity

**⚙️ Configuration**:
- Single universal agent with tools (e.g., code executor, document analyzer)
- Prompts control task steps (e.g., “Explain, then provide code”)
- Intermediate interactions for error correction

**⚠️ Risks**:
- No concurrency, longer execution for long tasks
- Token overflow risk, mitigated by summarization and step-wise strategies

**🔎 Example**:
“Generate a Python script for sales data analysis with a trend chart.”
→ Agent explains logic → Writes code → User confirms → Generates script → Renders chart.

> No need to orchestrate workflows or specify tools; the agent autonomously completes the process.

## Choosing a Mode: Task Characteristics and Reusability

| Feature          | Multi-Agent Mode        | Single-Agent Mode      |
|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Parallelization  | Strong, suits task decomposition | Weak, suits sequential tasks |
| Context Sharing  | None, main agent coordinates | Full context retention |
| Controllability  | Moderate, needs prompt design | High, traceable flow |
| Suitable Tasks   | Multi-source integration, research | Programming, writing, audits |
| Agent Reusability | High, modular expert components | Moderate, task-specific |
| Risk Control     | Context fragmentation, inconsistency | Token pressure, efficiency |

In XpertAI, both modes are flexibly selected via project creation. Multi-agent for information integration; single-agent for context-heavy tasks. Agents are configured as reusable “digital experts,” forming an enterprise “smart capability library.”

## How to Configure a Project

### Step 1: Create Project
Click “New Project” on the “Conversation” homepage and name it.

### Step 2: Add Resources
In the “Tools” tab:
- **✅ Tools** (e.g., bash, browser, custom APIs for system integration)
- **✅ Attachments**: Upload spreadsheets, contracts, blueprints
- **✅ Knowledge Base**: Add manuals, standards, past cases
- **✅ Digital Experts**: Select or create experts via “Add Expert”

### Step 3: Engage Project Team
Switch to “Exploration Mode” to issue commands; the agent auto-calls resources. In “Planning Mode,” the agent outlines task steps before execution.

## Case Studies

| Scenario           | Mode        | Capabilities Involved            |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Monthly Sales Report | Single-Agent | File tools, knowledge base, charting |
| Job Description Writing | Multi-Agent | Job expert, language optimizer, norms |
| Budget Forecasting | Single-Agent | Excel, budget rules, prediction tools |
| Competitor Analysis | Multi-Agent | Search, summarization, visualization experts |

## Comparison with Other Products

| Feature            | XpertAI       | Coze Space | ManusAI | SunaAI |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Multi-Agent Orchestration | ✅ Expert collaboration | ❌ | Partial | ❌ |
| Custom Tool Integration | ✅ Highly extensible | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Enterprise Knowledge Integration | ✅ Full support | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| File Comprehension | ✅ Strong | Average | Strong | Moderate |
| Ease of Use        | Low barrier | High | Moderate | Moderate |

## Summary

Multi-agent isn’t a cure-all; single-agent isn’t outdated. Success lies in **choosing the right mode for the task and structuring the system effectively**. XpertAI supports both modes, enhancing enterprise-grade agent reusability. Understand their boundaries to build flexible, reliable, and scalable agent systems.
