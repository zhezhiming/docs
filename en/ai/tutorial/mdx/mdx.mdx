### What is MDX

Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) is a query language specifically designed for accessing and manipulating multidimensional datasets. It is similar to SQL (Structured Query Language) in relational databases, but focuses on handling data in multidimensional data models. MDX was originally developed by Microsoft and is widely used in OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems such as Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and SAP BW.

### Features of MDX

1. **Multidimensional Queries**: MDX allows complex queries in multidimensional datasets, supporting operations such as slicing, dicing, pivoting, and drilling of data.
2. **Calculation Capabilities**: MDX provides rich calculation capabilities, including creating calculated members, defining key performance indicators (KPIs), and performing aggregate calculations.
3. **Time Intelligence**: MDX excels in handling time series analysis, making it easy to perform calculations such as year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, and moving averages.
4. **Built-in Functions**: MDX includes a wide range of built-in functions for manipulating dimensions, hierarchies, and measures, supporting complex data analysis requirements.
