Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) is a query language used to extract and manipulate data from multidimensional datasets, especially in Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) Cubes. The importance and practical use of MDX in Cubes are reflected in the following aspects:

### 1. Data Query and Analysis

MDX provides powerful querying capabilities, allowing users to perform complex queries and analysis on multidimensional data. Through MDX queries, users can extract data with multiple dimensions and hierarchies from Cubes and perform operations such as slicing, dicing, drilling down, and pivoting. These operations help users quickly obtain the desired information, supporting decision-making and analysis.

### 2. Calculation and Aggregation

MDX supports complex calculation and aggregation capabilities. Users can use MDX to define calculated members, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), measures, and more. For example, it is possible to calculate annual growth rate, year-over-year growth, cumulative totals, and so on. These calculation and aggregation capabilities enable users to analyze data trends and performance indicators in depth.

### 3. Time Analysis

MDX is particularly suitable for time series analysis. Through MDX, it is easy to perform operations on time dimensions, such as year-over-year comparisons, rolling averages, cumulative calculations, and more. Time analysis functionality allows businesses to better understand the temporal dynamics of their data, identify seasonal trends, and long-term changes.

### 5. Performance Optimization

MDX queries can optimize data access performance. When dealing with large datasets, MDX can improve query speed and response time through precomputation and aggregation. Writing and optimizing MDX queries properly can significantly enhance the performance of Cubes, providing a faster data access experience.

### Practical Use Cases

1. **Sales Analysis**: Use MDX queries to analyze sales data for different time periods, such as monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales. It is possible to calculate monthly sales growth rate and year-over-year changes.

     ```mdx
     WITH MEMBER [Measures].[Sales Growth] AS
            ([Measures].[Sales], [Time].[2024]) / 
            ([Measures].[Sales], [Time].[2023]) - 1
     SELECT 
            [Measures].[Sales Growth] ON COLUMNS,
            [Product].[Product Categories].Members ON ROWS
     FROM [Sales]
     WHERE ([Time].[Year].&[2024])
     ```

2. **Financial Analysis**: Use MDX to calculate key performance indicators such as net profit, gross profit margin for different financial periods, helping businesses monitor and analyze their financial health.

     ```mdx
     WITH MEMBER [Measures].[Gross Profit Margin] AS
            ([Measures].[Gross Profit]) / 
            ([Measures].[Revenue])
     SELECT 
            [Measures].[Gross Profit Margin] ON COLUMNS,
            [Time].[Quarter].Members ON ROWS
     FROM [Finance]
     ```

3. **Inventory Management**: Use MDX queries to analyze inventory turnover, inventory levels, and optimize inventory management and supply chain operations.

     ```mdx
     WITH MEMBER [Measures].[Inventory Turnover] AS
            ([Measures].[Cost of Goods Sold]) / 
            ([Measures].[Average Inventory])
     SELECT 
            [Measures].[Inventory Turnover] ON COLUMNS,
            [Warehouse].[Warehouse Locations].Members ON ROWS
     FROM [Inventory]
     ```

### Summary

MDX plays a crucial role in Cubes, helping users perform complex multidimensional data analysis and reporting through its powerful querying and calculation capabilities. The application of MDX not only enhances the efficiency of data analysis but also provides strong support for business decision-making, enabling businesses to maintain a leading position in a competitive market.
